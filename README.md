# Music Collection Finder
--------

Have you ever been at a party, when an awesome song starts playing, and then someone exclaims, "Whoa! I love this song! I remember when it came out.... 2004 was such a good year!"?

Then, someone else goes, "This song didn't come out until 2005... ðŸ™„"

Well, this app helps avoid situations like that.

This app uses the Apple Music API to find music collection by any artist

1. Enter the artist's name in the form input.
2. Click on the button.
3. Sit back and be amazed. ðŸ™‚

From here, you can click on any album to closer inspect the album artwork, release year, and you can even access a link to go to the relevant album page on Apple Music.

Click anywhere on the screen to go back to the home page.

Enjoy! ðŸ˜€
